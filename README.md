# StarCraft II Multi-Agent Environment Manual

# Introduction

This repository provides a unfied multi-agent environment for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. It is largely based on the [BenchMARL](https://benchmarl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. In addition to StarCraft II environment, it includes support for various other environments such as VMAS, PettingZoo, MeltingPot and MAgent2. Using this repository, you can compare your own MARL algorithm against well-known baselines such as MAPPO, IPPO, MADDPG, and more.

# Installation

For usage instructions, please refer to the [BenchMARL repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/BenchMARL?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use). After that, to use StarCraft II environment, make sure to follow installation guide provided in the [SMACv2 repository](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smacv2?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)
